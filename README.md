# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques to enhance transaction security and minimize fraudulent activities.

## Overview
This project aims to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains anonymized transaction data with features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and engineered principal components.

## Features
- Data preprocessing, including handling imbalanced datasets.
- Implementation of machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
- Visualization of results and insights from the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains:
- 284,807 transactions.
- 492 fraudulent transactions (0.172%).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Preprocess the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
